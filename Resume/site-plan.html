    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this project is to help create a site to house not only my resume, but more information about me in
    in order to see if I'm the right person for the job. In this website I will be including several different options to
    not only introduce myself, but hopefully get more accquainted with you.
    </p>
  <p>
  Within the project page, I would like your input on what you think would be better ideas. I would like your questions as well so I can be helpful to you in 
  your future endeavors. Questions such as: why did you use a Bluetooth server for communication between the phone and robot? Why are you creating your own model 
  for this robot to learn from object detection? Each of these questions will go straight to my email, I will respond as soon as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m hoping that this site will be a useful insight to not only my project, and how much progress I currently have, but also something to help judge 
    my character as an applicant under interest. I have a detailed list on my accomplishments, what makes me a good choice in the devOps field, but most importantly 
    I also have a downloadable content section to allow a basic summary if needed.
  </p>
    <p> 
    On my projects page you will notice a project that I have been working on for years. Since I don't want to overwhelm whomever
    might be interested, I'm going to be breaking this up into parts. These parts will include the title of this part, pictures, detailed
    descriptions of said part, github links if needed for the code I used, and will also have an option for the person interested in the project
    to leave questions and comments.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>There are two different groups I’m hoping to come to this site. The first group will be people trying to get a better view on why they would want to hire me. 
      In this regard I have provided information regarding work experience, schooling, projects that I’ve worked on outside of work, and contact information. All this 
      information is going to also be summarized in downloadable content on my main page. The second group will be people that I’m hoping will be interested in the project, 
      this site will let them either contribute or take inspiration from some of the work I’ve accomplished.
    </p>

    <P>
      This site is interactive and as such does provide ways to contribute to the project I have and respond on this page with questions or suggestions. With this being 
      interactive, I’m also hoping that the users on my main page will also be able to contact me using any of the various methods suggested.
    </P>
    
    <h3>Site Stucture Planning</h3>
    <P>
      To toggle my project page’s bits of detailed descriptions up you will be able to move through each one with a button to click next or previous. 
      To make sure that the image won’t take up the entire project page I will also have a “photo” section of these parts of the project. The photo section 
      is going to be to the left of the description of the part. These photos will be able to be seen in one conglomerate with the option to download or view the images 
      individually from this conglomerate.
    </P>

    <P>
      In the home page it’s going to be more information about me in relation to work. 
      This information will include my resume (A word document), accomplishments, and basic work experience/ accomplishments. 
    </P>

    <P>
      The header is going to include my “logo” that I will use throughout this resume project in the top right corner. This will be colored in the navy blue 
      I’m using and have navigational options to the contact info, project page, and site-plan. At the very top and below the header, I’m hoping to have a picture of me 
      with the basic overview (a paragraph) of a re-iteration of my purpose and the kind of work I’m look for.
    </P>

    <P>
      Right below the purpose and kind of work I’m looking for, I’m going to add my work experience to the more right – center of the page. 
      This will include the company, type of job, time worked, position if needed, and basic description. To the left of my job descriptions it’s going to be my resume 
      as a downloadable word document. Below my resume I’ll also have a downloadable content as with my experience, accomplishments, and projects I’ve been working on 
      as a word document.
    </P>

    <P>
      Below my work experience and downloadable content, I’m going to have the subsection that makes up the bottom half area of my page. This subsection will 
      take up the entire width of the page unlike the previous subsection. This will be my schooling that I’ve gotten detailing the experience. It’s also going to have 
      the badges I’ve earned on the site tryhackme.com. As a sidenote, besides the schooling this will all be included in both my resume and 
      experience/accomplishments/projects. The downloadable content will be more summarized.
    </P>
    
    <P>
      At the very bottom of my page, or the footer it’s going to be where I put a link to the contact me page. With some basic contact information. 
      The footer is going to include the date edited with my name, number, and apps to reach out to me. These apps are going to be facebook, linkedin, and gmail.
    </P>
