    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <P>
      I appreciate you looking at my page, I'm hoping I can answer many of your questions with my site. I think I would make a good canadite because of many different qualities
      that I possess. Once of the qualities that is essential for a workplace is being able to communicate clearly and well. This is something I have developed with over a decade
      of customer interactions. With these interactions comes learning from them, and I can confidently say that I've been able to master customer service and communication with
      peers.

      as moldable as possible in order to become my best self. It's a compliment I've gotten multiple times by multiple people and I'm very proud of it.
