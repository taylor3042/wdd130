    <h2>About Page (WIP)</h2>
    <P>
        In the home page it’s going to be more information about me in relation to work. 
        This information will include my resume (A word document), accomplishments, and basic work experience/ accomplishments. 
      </P>
  
      <P>
        The header is going to include my “logo” that I will use throughout this resume project in the top right corner. This will be colored in the navy blue 
        I’m using and have navigational options to the contact info, project page, and site-plan. At the very top and below the header, I’m hoping to have a picture of me 
        with the basic overview (a paragraph) of a re-iteration of my purpose and the kind of work I’m look for.
      </P>
  
      <P>
        Right below the purpose and kind of work I’m looking for, I’m going to add my work experience to the more right – center of the page. 
        This will include the company, type of job, time worked, position if needed, and basic description. To the left of my job descriptions it’s going to be my resume 
        as a downloadable word document. Below my resume I’ll also have a downloadable content as with my experience, accomplishments, and projects I’ve been working on 
        as a word document.
      </P>
  
      <P>
        Below my work experience and downloadable content, I’m going to have the subsection that makes up the bottom half area of my page. This subsection will 
        take up the entire width of the page unlike the previous subsection. This will be my schooling that I’ve gotten detailing the experience. It’s also going to have 
        the badges I’ve earned on the site tryhackme.com. As a sidenote, besides the schooling this will all be included in both my resume and 
        experience/accomplishments/projects. The downloadable content will be more summarized.
      </P>
      
      <P>
        At the very bottom of my page, or the footer it’s going to be where I put a link to the contact me page. With some basic contact information. 
        The footer is going to include the date edited with my name, number, and apps to reach out to me. These apps are going to be facebook, linkedin, gmail, 
        and the contact us page.
      </P>
