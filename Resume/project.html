    This is my robotics project. In my project this robot can do basic chores by asking the user what it would like to do. When the user gives this robot
    a task the robot to the best of it's ability will recognize objects within the parameters given. If it doesn't know the object name or can't find this object
    it will ask the user to provide the robot with this object. 
</p>

<p> 
    Since I have been working on this for years and don't want to overwhelm whoever
    might be interested, I'm going to be breaking this up into parts. These parts will include the title of this part, pictures, detailed
    descriptions of said part, github links/downloadable code files if needed for the code I used, and will also have an option for the person interested in the project
    to leave questions and comments.
</p>
<p>
    These parts will be able to be navigated through the forward and back buttons. For each of these parts of the project I will allow the users to input comments
    and questions. These will go to my personal email and I can respond through the email. The visual of what this design will look like is on the site plan page.
