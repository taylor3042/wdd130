    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        I'm originally from MN, Apple Valley. I really enjoy the outdoors including hiking, swimming, and biking. I'm married to my lovely wife Megan, we've
        only been together for a year and I'm excited for more years. As you can tell I'm very passionate about my project and I'm hoping that it will create
        oppurtunity for more projects in the future. My favorite food to make and eat is Cajun Pasta, if you don't know what that is and are currently
        living in Rexburg I'd be very excited to show you. Currently I am living in Rexburg, and if you are as well (or near) and would prefer to meet in person I would be more than
        willing to do that as well, so long as it's neither of the McDonalds in Town.
    </p>

   <h3>Contact Methods:</h3>

    <p>Although it is best practice to text, call, or email. I will be as quick as I can, and respond to any of these other methods. Thank you!</p>
