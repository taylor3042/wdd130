<body>
    <p>
    This page will include my email, phone number, linkedIn, github, and facebook. I will also give my city location
    and let people know I'd be willing to meet in person within "Current City"
    </p>

    <p>Unlike my resume-like main page this will also have a small description of me with this first paragraph, and to feel
        more personable I will also use a profile pic with me and my wife.
