    <p> Hey everyone! My name is Taylor, I'm from MN, Apple Valley. My hobbies include spending time with my wife, getting into robotics
    projects, spending time outdoors hiking or camping, and playing games. I am married and we don't have kid's yet, 
    but are hoping to have kids once I graduate</p>
    <p>My current job is working for the IT Service Desk for BYUI, and I love it. 
    My major is getting into Cyber security with a minor in a computer science. 
    I'm already into my sophmore year and have four semesters to go. My dream job would be to work as a cyber security engineer at almost any company.
    There's a lot of reasons to learn about web design, and for me
    it would be to know about how it works in order to help others avoid vulnerabilites in their web pages.</p>
    <p>
    I have been a member of the church all my life along with my wife. I really love the scripture Alma 30:44 :
    "But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, 
    and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the 
    face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator."
